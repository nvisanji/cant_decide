# cant_decide
iOS for designers group project

This app is for those people who have a hard time making decisions. It allows the user to create a collection with tasks or items added to their collections. The user can then use the built in planning or selection tool to choose a specific task to complete based on the time they have, or to plan a series of tasks within a collection to create a roadmap.
